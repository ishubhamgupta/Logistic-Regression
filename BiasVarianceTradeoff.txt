** Bias-Variance Trade-off **

- The bias varaince trade-off is the point where we are adding just noise by adding model complexity(flexibility)
- The training error goess down as it has to, but the test error is starting to go up
- The model after the bias trae-off begins to overfit


- A common temptstion for beginners is to continually add complexity to a model until it fits the training set very well
- Doing this can cause a model to overfit to your raining data and cause large errors on new data such as the test set
