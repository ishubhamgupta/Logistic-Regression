** Logistic regression **

- Some examples of classification problems:
	~ Spam vs 'Ham' emails
	~ Loan Default (yes / no)
	~ Disease Diagnosis
All these examples are binary classification


- Logistic regression allows ud to solve classification problems, where we are trying to predict discrete categories
- The convention for binary classification is to have two classes of 0 and 1
- We can't use a normal linear regression model on binary groups. it won't lead to a good fir

~~ SIGMOID FUNCTION ~~

- The sigmoid (aka logistic) function takes in any value and outputs it to be between 0 and 1
- This means that we can take our linear regression solution and place it into the sigmoid function
- This result in a probability from 0 to 1 of belonging in the 1 class
- We can set a cut off point at 0.5 anything below it results in class 0, anything above is class 1


~~ Model Evaluation ~~

- After you train a logistic regression model on some training data, we will evealuate our model's performance on some test data
- We can use a confusion matrix to evaluate classification models


~~ Confusion Matrix ~~
 > True positive (TP)
 > True negative (TN)
 > False positive (FP)
 > False negative (FP)
